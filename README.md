# w3schools
i am learning coding B)

# java
java is one of the more fun languages, in my opinion. i had a lot of fun learning the basics! i think that with a bit of learning, i can create something that is very cool.

# c
ah, c. the one language that i dislike. now, don't get me wrong, i think that the c language family is fun, but c is my enemy out of the three. i would do things in it if i absolutely had to. but i don't have to. so i'm not gonna use it.

# c++ 
c++! my favorite out of the three. i really like the syntax for it, it's very easy to get used to as someone who mainly did python. i'd choose this out of all the c languages every time.
10/10

# c sharp
hm, c sharp. i think that i like c sharp because of it's similar syntax to java with the functionality and flexibility of c languages. but it's also a bit too much for me to want to type "Console.WriteLine();" everytime while i'm learning the absolute basics. i do enjoy working with it though.
